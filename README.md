# ECE-385-Digital-System-Lab
This course is designed to give students in computer and electrical engineering an ability to design, build, and debug digital systems that include microprocessors, memory systems, and peripherals.

Topics:

  Combinational logic circuits
  Storage elements
  Hazards and race conditions
  Circuit characteristics (fanout, delays, etc.)
  Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
  Combinational networks (adders, multiplexes, etc.) in SystemVerilog
  Sequential networks (counters, shift registers, etc.) in SystemVerilog
  Synchronous state machines
  Static timing analysis, clock domains, metastability, and synchronization
  Microprocessors and system on chip
  Project using a microprocessor and system on chip concepts
